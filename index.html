During the course of life, each of us is engaged on an inner journey. Rumi?s little Book of life is a guidebook for that journey. The poetry is a companion for those who consciously enter the inner world to explore the gardens within-out of the everyday ?world of dust?-through an ascending hierarchy that restores one?s soul to the heart; the heart of the spirit; and in finding spirit, transcends all.

It highlights the poet's intense response to the magnificence of the universe or rather an affirmation of life with all its abundance, mystery and diversity. ">
